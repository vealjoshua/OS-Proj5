I could not finish this program. I have the base set up. I could not finish the releasing resources and deadlock.

I somehow broke my oss.c implemeintg recieving resources

run ./Memclean if anything goes wrong it kill all users and oss and releases all my memory

-----commands-----
-h or -help  : shows steps on how to use the program 
-s x         : x is the maximum number of slave processes spawned (default 8) 
-l filename  : change the log file name (default test.out)
-t z         : parameter z is the time in seconds when the master will terminate itself (default 20) 
-v v         : changes what is printed to the logfile (default 1)
